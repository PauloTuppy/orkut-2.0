# Raindrop MCP Configuration for Orkut 2.0

# This file outlines the desired configuration for Raindrop MCP to orchestrate
# the build, deployment, and infrastructure management of the Orkut 2.0 project.
# The specific syntax and available options should be replaced with actual
# Raindrop MCP configuration as per its documentation.

project:
  name: "Orkut 2.0"
  description: "The platform Meta should have built, orchestrated by Raindrop MCP."

services:
  backend:
    name: "orkut-backend"
    path: "./backend"
    language: "Python"
    framework: "FastAPI"
    # Raindrop MCP's SmartSQL will manage the database schema and migrations
    database:
      type: "PostgreSQL"
      managed_by: "SmartSQL" # SmartSQL will handle schema, PII detection, migrations, indexing, retention
    cache:
      type: "Redis"
    # Environment variables and secrets would be managed by Raindrop MCP
    # Example:
    # environment:
    #   DATABASE_URL: ${RAINDROP_SECRET_STAGING_DATABASE_URL}
    #   REDIS_URL: ${RAINDROP_SECRET_STAGING_REDIS_URL}
    #   JWT_SECRET: ${RAINDROP_SECRET_JWT_SECRET}
    #   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY: ${RAINDROP_SECRET_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY}
    #   ENVIRONMENT: "staging"

  frontend:
    name: "orkut-frontend"
    path: "./frontend"
    language: "TypeScript"
    framework: "React"
    # Environment variables and secrets would be managed by Raindrop MCP
    # Example:
    # environment:
    #   VITE_API_URL: ${RAINDROP_SERVICE_ORKUT_BACKEND_URL}

deployment:
  provider: "Google Cloud Run"
  region: "us-central1"
  # Raindrop MCP will handle the automatic stages:
  # 1. Requirements Analysis
  # 2. Architecture Design
  # 3. Database Schema (via SmartSQL)
  # 4. Code Generation (via Gemini contextual)
  # 5. Testing (pytest + vitest)
  # 6. Infrastructure Setup (Raindrop provisiona)
  # 7. Deployment (Cloud Run)
  # 8. Monitoring Setup (Sentry + Logging)

  environments:
    staging:
      # Configuration specific to staging environment
      # e.g., resource limits, scaling, custom domains
      backend_service_name: "orkut-backend-staging"
      frontend_service_name: "orkut-frontend-staging"
    production:
      # Configuration specific to production environment
      # e.g., resource limits, scaling, custom domains
      backend_service_name: "orkut-backend"
      frontend_service_name: "orkut-frontend"

# Secrets management would be integrated with Raindrop MCP's secure storage
# This section is conceptual and depends on Raindrop MCP's actual implementation.
secrets:
  # Define secrets that Raindrop MCP should manage and inject into services
  - name: "STAGING_DATABASE_URL"
  - name: "PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL"
  - name: "STAGING_REDIS_URL"
  - name: "PRODUCTION_REDIS_URL"
  - name: "JWT_SECRET"
  - name: "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  - name: "SLACK_WEBHOOK"
  # Add any other secrets required by the application
